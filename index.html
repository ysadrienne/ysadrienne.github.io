                            <p>Before starting the tasks, I installed Bleak on my computer, as I was getting pip errors. 
                                After troubleshooting by restarting the Jupyter notebook, correcting directories, and reinstalling the codebase,
                                I reset the environment with the correct packages. I also had to grant Bluetooth access to IDE on my computer for the board to connect successfully.</p>
                            <p>For setting up the virtual environment named <i>FastRobots_ble</i>, I used the following commands provided:</p>
                            <p><pre><code>
                            python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
                            python3 -m venv FastRobots_ble
                            </code></pre></p>
                            <p>Then, I created a folder '4190' to keep all my codes and environments for the class, and activated the BLE virtual environment by sourcing it.</p>
                            <p>To establish a bluetooth connection with my computer, I updated the Artemis MAC address. 
                                I connected my board, to the Arduino BLE and used <i>ble_arduino.ino</i> to print the MAC address to my serial monitor:</p>
                            <p><pre><code>
                            Advertising BLE with MAC: c0:81:19:26:a9:64
                            Connected to: 3c:6:30:b:ac:c1</code></pre></p>
                            <p>I then generated a UUID unique to my computer for secure connection, using the code provided in <i>demo.ipynb</i>:</p>
                            <p><img src="assets/img/lab1b/uuid.jpg" alt="..." class="center"></p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>Lastly, I replaced the placeholders in the <i>connections.yaml</i> file with my MAC address and the UUID generated:</p>
                            <p><pre><code>
                            artemis_address: 'c0:81:19:26:a9:64'

                            <p>After completing these steps, I could see the connection was successful.</p>

                            <p>Writeup</p>

                            <!--Task 1-->
                            <h3 class="mb-0">Task 1: ECHO command</h3>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>The <code>ECHO</code> command sends a string from the computer to the Artemis board, which the computer then modifies and sends back. 
                                <code>tx_estring_value</code> adds <code>Robot says -> </code> to the front of the string and appends a 
                                <code>:)</code> at the end of the string, and <code>tx_characteristic_string</code> sends it to the computer.</p> 
                            
                            <p>The following is the Arduino code: </p>
                            <script src="https://gist.github.com/ysadrienne/2d53057a4f309e8e304d0cde86c476b6.js"></script>

                            <p>The following is the Python output when the string <code>"Hi"</code> is sent to the board: </p>
                            <p><img src="assets/img/lab1b/echo.jpg" alt="..." class="center"></p>

                            <!--Task 2-->
                            <h3 class="mb-0">Task 2: SEND_THREE_FLOATS command</h3>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>The <code>SEND_THREE_FLOATS</code> command sends three floats to the Artemis board, which the computer extracts and sends back. 
                                Like the <code>ECHO</code> command, <code>tx_estring_value</code> modifies the string by appending the floats, and <code>tx_characteristic_string</code> sends it to the computer.</p> 
                                
                            <p>The following is the Arduino code: </p>
                            <script src="https://gist.github.com/ysadrienne/a1242fe63bff4bca3d6098ecd1961667.js"></script>
                        
                            <p>The following is the Python output when floats <code>2.0|-6.0|0.5</code> are sent to the board: </p>
                            <p><img src="assets/img/lab1b/floats.jpg" alt="..." class="center"></p> 

                            <!--Task 3-->
                            <h3 class="mb-0">Task 3: GET_TIME_MILLIS command</h3>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>The <code>GET_TIME_MILLIS</code> command fetches a timestamp of how much time has elapsed since the board was connected, in milliseconds, then creates a string to print containing the information.  
                               the computer then prints. </p>
                            <p>Since this was a new command, after adding the command to the switch-case chain, I made sure to add it to <i>cmd_types.py</i> and <code>enum CommandTypes</code>. 
                                Same steps were taken for the remaining tasks that require creating a new command. For the two commands above (<code>ECHO</code> and <code>SEND_THREE_FLOATS</code>), this was unnecessary as they already existed in the file.</p>

                            <p>The following is the Arduino code, in which the timestamp is appended to a string <code>'T: '</code></p>
                            <script src="https://gist.github.com/ysadrienne/97627987be0ed39c09258e85adcdab11.js"></script>

                            <p>The following is the output printed to the serial monitor when the command is executed: </p> 
                            <p><img src="assets/img/lab1b/gettimesm.jpg" alt="..." class="center"></p> 
                            <p>The following is the Python output after execution, and we can see that the two numbers match, verifying successful transmission. </p> 
                            <p><img src="assets/img/lab1b/gettimepy.jpg" alt="..." class="center"></p> 

                            <!--Task 4-->
                            <h3 class="mb-0">Task 4: Setting Up Notification Handler</h3>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>To setup a notification handler, I referenced the Member Function table in the <i>demo.ipynb</i> file. </p>

                            <p>The following shows the Python code for the notification handler and an output of the timestamp extracted. 
                                It is printed as an array of 1 element, since I appended the string to an empty array called <code>times</code>. </p> 
                            <p><img src="assets/img/lab1b/handlerpy.jpg" alt="..." class="center"></p> 

                            <p>The serial monitor printed out the same timestamp, verifying successful transmission. </p>
                            <p><img src="assets/img/lab1b/handlersm.jpg" alt="..." class="center"></p>
                            <p>There was no new Arduino code, as all we are doing is receiving the string created by the <code>GET_TIME_MILLIS</code> command.</p>

                            <p>In the <code>CURRENT_TIME_LOOP</code> command, I used a <code>for</code> loop to retrieve multiple timestamps to be sent to my computer and received by the notification handler.
                                I defined local variables <code>currentTime</code> and <code>startTime</code> to loop for 5000 milliseconds, and <code>timeCount</code> in order to track each timestamp to monitor how many were sent.
                                </p>
                            
                            <p>The following is the Arduino code: </p>
                            <script src="https://gist.github.com/ysadrienne/fd3b3fe269e1f975d3ce6a92728cdeb1.js"></script>

                            <p>The following is the last few lines of output in the serial monitor showing 568 datapoints: </p>
                            <p><img src="assets/img/lab1b/loopsm.jpg" alt="..." class="center"></p> 
                            
                            <p>On Python, I printed the number of datapoints from the loop to verify correct data transmission, as printing all datapoints would take up too much space. </p>
                            <p><img src="assets/img/lab1b/looppy.jpg" alt="..." class="center"></p> 

                            <p>568 messages were sent over 5 seconds, and the effective data transfer rate calculated is around 113.6 messages per second. 
                                One thing I did not consider when writing code for this is the size of each message -- There were 10 of 18 byte messages (single digit <code>timeCount</code>), 
                                89 of 19 byte messages (double digit <code>timeCount</code>), and 469 of 20 byte messages (triple digit <code>timeCount</code>) meaning the actual rate would be slightly different.</p>

                            <!--Task 6-->
                            <h3 class="mb-0">Task 6: Setting Up Time Array</h3>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>As opposed to sending individual messages one by one, the <code>SEND_TIME_DATA</code> command creates an array that stores 1000 timestamps using <code>millis()</code>. </p>
                            
                            <p>The following is the Arduino code: </p>
                            <script src="https://gist.github.com/ysadrienne/429347d53cc92ba9e6d6afd88117c2ac.js"></script>

                            <p>The first <code>for</code> loop creates and adds 1000 elements to an array called <code>timeArray</code>, 
                                and second <code>for</code> loop appends the data collected to a string to be printed.</p>

                            <p>The following is the last few lines of output in the serial monitor, where we can see 1000 datapoints were printed: </p>
                            <p><img src="assets/img/lab1b/arraysm.jpg" alt="..." class="center"></p> 
                                
                            <p>Similar to what I did for Task 5, I printed the length of the array on Python to verify correct data transmission, as printing all datapoints would take up too much space. </p> 
                            <p><img src="assets/img/lab1b/arraypy.jpg" alt="..." class="center"></p> 

                            <p>It wasn't captured in the screenshot above, but to calculate the effective data transfer rate, I counted the number of messages sent in a second by looking at the number of strings with the same timestamp.
                                There were 62 entries of 16 byte messages with the timestamp <code>257359</code>, so the rate was 62 messages per second, or 992 bytes per second.
                            </p>
                            
                            <!--Task 7-->
                            <h3 class="mb-0">Task 7: Setting Up Temperature Array with Time</h3>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>Like the <code>SEND_TIME_DATA</code> command, <code>GET_TEMP_READINGS</code> command creates an array with 1000 elements using <code>getTempDegF()</code>.
                                The difference is that now the array stores temperature readings in Fahrenheit (very much inferior to Celcius in my opinion), and prints both timestamp and temperature.</p>
                            
                            <p>In order to achieve this, I created another array called <code>tempArray</code> inside the first <code>for</code> loop, then appended the data to the string in the second <code>for</code> loop.</p>
                                 
                            <p>The following is the Arduino code: </p>
                            <script src="https://gist.github.com/ysadrienne/470e20de55b95c75f6fb12c8c6745c0f.js"></script>

                            <p>The following is the last few lines of output in the serial monitor, where we can see 1000 datapoints of timestamp and temperature were printed: </p>
                            <p><img src="assets/img/lab1b/temsm.jpg" alt="..." class="center"></p> 
                                
                            <p>Similar to what I did for Task 5 and 6, I printed the length of the array on Python to verify correct data transmission, as printing all datapoints would take up too much space. </p>
                            <p><img src="assets/img/lab1b/tempy.jpg" alt="..." class="center"></p>

                            <p></p>
                            <p>Discuss the differences between these two methods, the advantages and disadvantages of both and the potential scenarios that you might choose one method over the other. 
                                How âquicklyâ can the second method record data? The Artemis board has 384 kB of RAM. 
                                Approximately how much data can you store to send without running out of memory?</p>

                            <p>This lab was a great exercise for me -- as a mechanical engineer with minimal coding background, it was a good level of difficulty to start with.
                                </p>
                            <p>It was also my first time using GitHub and HTML to create a website. Formatting was a bit tricky in the beginning,
                                but now I am quite satisfied with how I structured my HTML file and the presentation of my website (mostly thanks to the template). I feel more confident about adding future writeups!</p>
